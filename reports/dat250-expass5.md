# DAT250 Experiment Assignment 5 - report

Only issue I've stumbled upon with this experiment is not being able to easily find version 4.4, so I ended up using 7.0.14 while working on this.

## Screenshots:

### experiment 2:

I made a javascript file to do the mapReduction from the tutorial, the following is the result of using it. <br>
[mapReduce file](../exp5/mongodbTesting.js) <br>

I added another map-reduce operation to the same file that aims to count the number of each item that have been sold, you can see the result below. <br>

This can be useful in finding what items are the most popular with customers, this can allow the business to make data-driven decisions about how to best manage their inventory of items.
